                    <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                    <p>Elephants are the largest living land animals.Three living species are currently recognised:the African
                        bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant.They are the only surviving members of the 
                        family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea;extinct members include the mammoths and the mastodons.
                        Distinctive features of elephants include a lond proboscis called a trunk,tusks,large ears,pillar-like legs,
                        and tough but sensitive grey skin.The trunk is prehensible and is used for many purposes,including feeding,drinking
                        and social interaction.Tuaks,which are derived from the incisor teeth,serve as tools for moving objects and digging.
                        Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in a variety of habitats,including savannas,forests,deserts and marshes.
                        African elephants are generally larger than their Asian relatives,with larger ears and tusks.
                     They communicate using a variety of vocalizations, body language, and even infrasound. Elephants are known for
                    their intelligence, memory, and complex social structures. They exhibit behaviors such as mourning their dead, playing, and forming strong bonds with family members.
                    They help to shape their environment by creating water holes, clearing paths through dense vegetation, and dispersing seeds through their dung.
