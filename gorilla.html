                    <h3>GORILLA</h3>
            <p>Gorrilas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous apes that inhabit the forests of central Africa.The eponymous
                genus gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorrilas and the western gorrilas,and either four or five subspecies.
                They the largest living primates by physical size.The DNA of gorrilas is highly similar to that of humans,from 95 to 99% depending
                on what is counted,and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after the chimpanzees and bonobos.
                Gorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forests in Africa.Although their range covers a small percentage of Africa,gorrilas cover
                a wide range of elevations. The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift mountain cloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes,ranging in altitude
                from 2,200 to 4,300 metres (7,200 to 14,100 ft0)
