                    <h3>PANDA</h3>
            <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) also knowns as the panda bear or simply panda,is a bear native to south central China. It is easliy
                recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, and across its round body. The name "panda" is sometimes used to 
                distinguish it from unrelated red panda. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda's diet is over 99% bamboo. Giant pandas
                in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses,wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds,rodents or carrion.
