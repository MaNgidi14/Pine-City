                <h3>KOALA</h3>
                <p>The koala (Phascolartos cinereus),or,inaccurately,koala bear is an herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae
                    and its closest living relatives are the wombats, which are members of the family Vombatidae. The koala is found in coastal regions of eastern and southern Australia, inhabiting
                    open eucalypt forests and woodlands. The koala is a tree-dwelling (arboreal) herbivore that feeds almost exclusively on the leaves of eucalyptus trees. It has a very low metabolic rate
                    and a specialized digestive system that allows it to extract the maximum amount of nutrients from its food. Koalas are nocturnal and spend most of their time sleeping in trees.
                    They sleep for up to 20 hours a day and are most active at night. Koalas are social animals and live in groups called colonies. They communicate with each other using a variety of vocalizations, including grunts, bellows, and screams.
                    Koalas are also known for their distinctive appearance, with large, round ears, a flat nose, and a thick coat of fur that helps to keep them warm in cooler weather. They are often seen clinging to tree trunks or sitting on branches, and they are well adapted to life in the trees.
