                    <h3>LION</h3>
            <p>The lion(Panthera leo) is one of the five big cats in the genes Panthera and a memeber of the family
                Felidea. The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies found in Africa.
                With some males exceeding 250 kg(550 Ib) in weight,it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger.
                Wild lion currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia(where an endagered remant population resides in the Gir forest
                National Park in India) while other types of lions are extinct.</p>
                
           <p>The lion is vulnerable species,having seen a major population decline in its African range of 30 to 50 per two decades during the second half of the twentieth century.
            Lion population are untenable outside designated reserves and nationalparks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts
            with humans are currently the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa,the West African lion population is particularly endangered.</p>
            <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
            <p>You will find the lions at the Northern Frontier.</p>
