                    <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                <p>The Gemsbok is a large antelope in the genus Oryx. It is endemic to the dry and barren regions of Bostwana,
                    Namibia,South Africa and parts of Angola.The gemsbok is known for its long,starking horns,which can reach up to 1 meter 
                    in length. These horns are used as defense against predators and for establishing dominace within their social grounds.
                    Gemsboks are well adapted to susrvive in arid environments, as they can go for long periods without water by obtaining moisture from
                    the vegetation they consume.
                </p>
                <p>Gemsboks are social animals and are often found in herds of 10 to 40 individuals. They are herbivorous and primarily feed on grasses, 
                    leaves, and shrubs. Their unique adaptations allow them to thrive in harsh desert conditions, making them a fascinating species to observe.
                <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                <p>You will find the gemsboks just beyond panda canyon.</p>
